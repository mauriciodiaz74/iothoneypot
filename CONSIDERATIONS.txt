GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS

This IoT-Honeypot is designed for Raspberry Pi (tested in Raspberry Pi 3B+ / Raspbian GNU/Linux 10 (buster). ).

Visit http://www.darkdefense.net/own/iothoneypot/supported, to learn about the Raspberry Pi versions supported so far.

If the device you are installing on is not a Raspberry Pi, or the model is not supported, we recommend that you cancel the installation.

This program does not support Raspberry Pi Virtual Machines, since they are only 32 bit (so far, there are no VM Raspberry Pi 3 64 bit version). The reason is because, this installation uses Docker, and there is no Docker 32 bit for Raspberry Pi.

This installation involves changing some of the system's parameters and the installation of additional packages, thus, take in account the following:

- The real SSH service, which by default is on port 22, will be moved to one that will be known only to you. You will be asked to which port you want to move this SSH service.
- The DOCKER container will be installed, in order to support the isolation of SSH and IoT honeypots.
- The false SSH service (SSH honeypot) using the usual port for this service (22). It will be visible to any port scan to the raspberry Pi.
- The RIOT microkernel operating system will be installed to support the deployment of high interaction virtual IoT devices. Each virtual IoT device has a virtualized communication port with real hardware address, so it is possible to send messages between them.
